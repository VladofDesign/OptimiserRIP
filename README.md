OptimizeRIP improves your computer's performance by managing and removing processes and applications you don't need while playing. This frees up valuable resources and the RAM needed for games, resulting in higher images per second and smoother game performance. In addition, a large number of registry keys and parameters will significantly reduce the input lag present.
